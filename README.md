### Project Description
A voice-controlled application that turns your music up or down based on how loudly you yell at it! The app uses real-time audio processing to detect voice intensity and adjusts system volume accordingly.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Control your volume by yelling‚Äîbecause who needs buttons when you have lungs? In a world where touching volume controls is just too mainstream, we bring you the solution nobody knew they needed!

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An app that adjusts your device's volume based on how loudly you yell‚Äîperfect for those moments when your voice needs to be heard... by your speakers! Features include:
- Real-time voice intensity detection
- Dynamic volume adjustment
- Visual feedback with live graphs
- Calibration system for different environments
- Cross-platform compatibility
